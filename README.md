# historical_livability_limitations
Project focused on using hourly ERA5-Land data to assess global historical temperature and humidity limitations on livability. Python code to calculate rh from ERA5-Land d2m and t2m, calculate livability assessment (METs) from hourly t2m and d2m, create monthly and annual summaries of hourly livability output saved in monthly chunks (nc files), and plot data.
